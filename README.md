# MHNibTableViewCell

**Warning:**Â This is an old class that is only useful on iOS 4 or lower. These days you should use UITableView's new `registerNib:forCellReuseIdentifier:` method instead, or even easier, use storyboards with prototype cells.

This is a UITableViewCell subclass that makes it easy to load table view cells from nib files. It works best on OS 4.0 or later because there it just loads the nib once; on earlier OS versions the nib is loaded for each table view cell.

The demo project shows several examples of using MHNibTableViewCell to make custom table view cells.

The ImagesCell and ImagesController classes from the "Background Images" demo are based on Matt Gallagher's EasyCustomTable example but have been completely rewritten to use nibs. See his original blog post at: http://cocoawithlove.com/2009/04/easy-custom-uitableview-drawing.html

The DrawingCell, GradientBackgroundTable, GradientCellBackground and RoundRect  classes from the "Background Drawing" demo are derived from Matt Gallagher's  TableDesignRevisited example. See his blog post at: http://cocoawithlove.com/2010/12/uitableview-construction-drawing-and.html
